A simple, responsive calculator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
This app allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) using an interactive button-based interface. The calculator manages input state internally, supports clearing and deleting values, and displays results dynamically without page reloads.
